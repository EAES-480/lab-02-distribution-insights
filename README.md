# Lab 01 — Hands-On Programming in R (HOPR)

**EAES 480: Modern Statistics in Earth & Environmental Science**  
University of Illinois Chicago  
Instructor: Dr. Gavin McNicol  

---

## Overview

This lab is based on the free online textbook  
**_Hands-On Programming in R_** by Garrett Grolemund.

The goal of this assignment is to ensure everyone in EAES 480 has a **shared, working foundation in R** before we move on to modern statistical modeling, data workflows, and reproducible research.

You will work through **Chapters 1–8** of the book by completing exercises directly in an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file.

## What You’ll Do

- Read **Chapters 1–8** of *Hands-On Programming in R*
- Complete the corresponding exercises in the provided R Markdown template
- Write and run your own R code in each chunk
- Knit the document to ensure it runs cleanly from top to bottom

This is a **practice-focused lab**, not a trick assignment. The goal is fluency, not perfection.
